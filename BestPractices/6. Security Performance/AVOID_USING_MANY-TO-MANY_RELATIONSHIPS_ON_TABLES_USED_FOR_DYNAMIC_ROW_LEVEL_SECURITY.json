  "Category": "6. Security Performance",
  "Description": "Using many-to-many relationships on tables which use dynamic row level security can cause serious query performance degradation. This pattern's performance problems compound when snowflaking multiple many-to-many relationships against a table which contains row level security. Instead, use one of the patterns shown in the article below where a single dimension table relates many-to-one to a security table.\r\n\r\nReference: https://www.elegantbi.com/post/dynamicrlspatterns",
