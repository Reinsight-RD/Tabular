  "Category": "1. Data Preparation",
  "Description": "Power BI does not support provider (a.k.a. 'legacy') partitions which reference structured data sources. Partitions which reference structured data sources must use the M-language. Otherwise, 'provider' partitions must reference a 'provider' data source. This can be resolved by converting the structured data source into a provider data source (see 2nd reference link below).\r\n\r\nReference: https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-premium-connect-tools#data-source-declaration\r\nReference: https://www.elegantbi.com/post/convertdatasources",
