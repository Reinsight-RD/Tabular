  "Description": "Perspectives that contain no objects (tables) are most likely not necessary. In this rule, it is only necessary to check tables as adding a column/measure/hierarchy to a perspective also adds the table to the perspective. Additionally, tables in general covers calculated tables and calculation groups as well.",
